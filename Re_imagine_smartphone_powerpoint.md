>  Re- Imagine Mobile Workspace Presentations: Creating Value from Smartphones in the Workplace Market

On **May 21st, 2025**, I took a matatu to **Anjarwalla & Khanna** Westlands office venue where **Adili Group** and **Microsoft** co-hosted a **Capture The Flag (****CTF****) event**. Around **100** young participants attended, filling the hall to capacity. Large-screen TVs were set up throughout the venue to ensure that every attendee could clearly see the presentations — a thoughtful touch by the organizers to ensure inclusivity and engagement. Ensuring no participant was left behind.




The Microsoft team had thoughtfully structured the program to facilitate _gradual learning_, with interactive simulations and challenges. Teams who successfully solved complex tasks were awarded **vouchers**, adding a competitive yet educational element to the session. Additionally, a group of young Microsoft specialists was on hand to offer guidance and clarify any doubts, ensuring that **no participant was left behind**.

Despite the overall success of the event, I found myself reflecting on how the **PowerPoint presentation** experience could be reimagined for mobile users. From my seat, the projected slides were sometimes difficult to read due to low contrast between the white background and the text. This made it challenging to follow along visually, forcing attendees to rely heavily on **active listening**. As active listening became a necessity— I saw a gap that highlighted an opportunity for innovation.
Given that nearly everyone in the room had access to a smartphone or laptop, there is a clear opportunity to enhance digital accessibility during such events.

Currently, Microsoft PowerPoint is primarily designed for large screens, and its mobile adaptation _feels like a direct copy of the desktop interface_. As a result, viewing shared presentations on smartphones can be unintuitive and inconvenient. Scrolling vertically through slides is not as seamless as flipping through them horizontally — a design flaw that hampers user experience

Let’s reimagine **Microsoft PowerPoint for Mobile** — not just as a scaled-down version of the desktop app, but as a purpose-built tool tailored for small screens and mobile interactions. Existing competitor apps tackling presentations are almost a clone of MS Powerpoint for desktop. 
My  inspiration for this Ux- Product redesign comes from two powerful examples: the _YouVersion Bible App_ and the _Clarity ADHD App by Fabulous_.
#### Key UX Design Insights:
* **Portrait Orientation**: Unlike traditional slide decks, which are landscape-oriented, mobile presentations should be viewed in **portrait mode**, aligning with how people naturally hold their phones.
* **Top-to-bottom Content Flow**: Each slide should present content in a vertical format, allowing for easy reading without horizontal resizing or panning.
* **Navigation via Tap Gestures**: To switch between slides, users can tap the ***left or right side*** of the screen — a gesture-based navigation system that feels intuitive on touchscreens.
* In contrast, current PowerPoint mobile still relies on **vertical scrolling,** which breaks the natural rhythm of slide transitions.Visual Inspiration from YouVersion Bible AppBelow is how YouVersion handles content delivery in a mobile-friendly way:

### Hypermedia Presentation Inspired by Clarity ADHD App 
Similarly, the **Clarity ADHD App** offers a compelling example of how hypermedia content can be presented in bite-sized, digestible formats on mobile devices. Key objective is to borrow from Clarity ADHD, blend multimedia (audio cues, animations) to sustain engagement without overwhelming users.  At Westlands we had some cool music playing in the background creating an ambient environment to hack and network.  Let’s add some vibe , applause ,and sound to the proposed MS Mobile .PPT.

### **Enhancing Engagement with Interactive Features**
Imagine integrating **simple polls** directly into the PowerPoint mobile experience. For instance, after a session, attendees could quickly rate the session (1–5), or indicate their level of expertise in CTF (Beginner to Expert). These responses could then be used to tailor the speaker’s presentation style in real time, offering ***instant feedback loops*** that improve engagement and relevance.

#### **Conclusion : Untapped Mobile Market**
By adopting this new design blueprint, ***Microsoft PowerPoint*** ***on mobile*** could become significantly more user-friendly and engaging. PowerPoint remains indispensable in professional settings, yet its mobile potential is underutilized. By adopting a smartphone-first design philosophy—embracing portrait layouts, intuitive gestures, and interactivity—Microsoft can dominate this niche, transforming digital presentations into seamless, inclusive experiences.
I invite Microsoft to consider this proposal and explore collaboration opportunities to bring this vision to life.
