    <h1>Re imagine smartphone powerpoint.</h1>
    <h4>James Kamau UX / Product Design</h4>

    <blockquote>
        Re- Imagine Mobile Workspace Presentations: Creating Value from Smartphones in the Workplace Market
    </blockquote>

    <p>On <strong>May 21st, 2025</strong>, I took a matatu to <strong>Anjarwalla & Khanna</strong> Westlands office
        venue where <strong>Adili Group</strong> and <strong>Microsoft</strong> co-hosted a <strong>Capture The Flag
            (CTF) event</strong>. Around <strong>100</strong> young participants attended, filling the hall to capacity.
        Large-screen TVs were set up throughout the venue to ensure that every attendee could clearly see the
        presentations — a thoughtful touch by the organizers to ensure inclusivity and engagement. Ensuring no
        participant was left behind.</p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://beta.appflowy.cloud/api/file_storage/f654ae2c-f6e7-4092-b982-55418eac0a71/v1/blob/b1da932f%2D203c%2D40b3%2D896c%2D042703461069/8L9HA1TtMmx4-oNjP-sX5ojpi0DqnbRDJMMFGZ6mhPA=.jpg"
            alt="#Image showing a sreeen with a timer ">
        <div class="image-caption">...</div>
    </div>
    <p>The Microsoft team had thoughtfully structured the program to facilitate <em>gradual learning</em>, with
        interactive simulations and challenges. Teams who successfully solved complex tasks were awarded
        <strong>vouchers</strong>, adding a competitive yet educational element to the session. Additionally, a group of
        young Microsoft specialists was on hand to offer guidance and clarify any doubts, ensuring that <strong>no
            participant was left behind</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>Despite the overall success of the event, I found myself reflecting on how the <strong>PowerPoint
            presentation</strong> experience could be reimagined for mobile users. From my seat, the projected slides
        were sometimes difficult to read due to low contrast between the white background and the text. This made it
        challenging to follow along visually, forcing attendees to rely heavily on <strong>active listening</strong>. As
        active listening became a necessity— I saw a gap that highlighted an opportunity for innovation. Given that
        nearly everyone in the room had access to a smartphone or laptop, there was a clear opportunity to enhance
        digital accessibility during such events.</p>

    <p>Currently, Microsoft PowerPoint is primarily designed for large screens, and its mobile adaptation <em>feels like
            a direct copy of the desktop interface</em>. As a result, viewing shared presentations on smartphones can be
        unintuitive and inconvenient. Scrolling vertically through slides is not as seamless as flipping through them
        horizontally — a design flaw that hampers user experience</p>
    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://beta.appflowy.cloud/api/file_storage/f654ae2c-f6e7-4092-b982-55418eac0a71/v1/blob/b1da932f%2D203c%2D40b3%2D896c%2D042703461069/3_xVqZuNNfWLyF1aOsDe7BmBc1-xHHs3zWyGebQTJ0U=.jpg"
            alt="current mobile ppt">
        
    </div>
    <p>Let's reimagine <strong>Microsoft PowerPoint for Mobile</strong> — not just as a scaled-down version of the
        desktop app, but as a purpose-built tool tailored for small screens and mobile interactions. Existing competitor
        apps tackling presentations are almost a clone of MS Powerpoint for desktop.</p>

    <p>My inspiration for this Ux- Product redesign comes from two powerful examples: the <em>YouVersion Bible App</em>
        and the <em>Clarity ADHD App by Fabulous</em>.</p>

    <h4>Key UX Design Insights:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Portrait Orientation</strong>: Unlike traditional slide decks, which are landscape-oriented, mobile
            presentations should be viewed in <strong>portrait mode</strong>, aligning with how people naturally hold
            their phones.</li>
        <li><strong>Top-to-bottom Content Flow</strong>: Each slide should present content in a vertical format,
            allowing for easy reading without horizontal resizing or panning.</li>
        <li><strong>Navigation via Tap Gestures</strong>: To switch between slides, users can tap the <strong><em>left
                    or right side</em></strong> of the screen — a gesture-based navigation system that feels intuitive
            on touchscreens.</li>
        <li>In contrast, current PowerPoint mobile still relies on <strong>vertical scrolling,</strong> which breaks the
            natural rhythm of slide transitions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Visual Inspiration from YouVersion Bible App</h3>
    <p>Below is how YouVersion handles content delivery in a mobile-friendly way:</p>

    <div class="image-container">
        <img src="https://beta.appflowy.cloud/api/file_storage/f654ae2c-f6e7-4092-b982-55418eac0a71/v1/blob/b1da932f%2D203c%2D40b3%2D896c%2D042703461069/gmoFq7r0UpynBnnKkteNHzMDSo-GozcAObsjl3JpIoc=.jpg"
            alt="YouVersion Bible App - Short video support">
        <div class="image-caption">Image showcasing short video support. Great for media playback. While desktop
            PowerPoint supports embedded videos, this feature is lost when presentations are exported to PDF for sharing
            with participants who need to review the content later.</div>

    </div>

    <h3>Hypermedia Presentation Inspired by Clarity ADHD App</h3>
    <p>Similarly, the <strong>Clarity ADHD App</strong> offers a compelling example of how hypermedia content can be
        presented in bite-sized, digestible formats on mobile devices. Key objective is to borrow from Clarity ADHD,
        blend multimedia (audio cues, animations) to sustain engagement without overwhelming users. At Westlands we had
        some cool music playing in the background creating an ambient environment to hack and network. Let's add some
        vibe, applause, and sound to the proposed MS Mobile .PPT.</p>

    </div>

    <h3>Enhancing Engagement with Interactive Features</h3>
    <p>Imagine integrating <strong>simple polls</strong> directly into the PowerPoint mobile experience. For instance,
        after a session, attendees could quickly rate the session (1–5), or indicate their level of expertise in CTF
        (Beginner to Expert). These responses could then be used to tailor the speaker's presentation style in real
        time, offering <strong><em>instant feedback loops</em></strong> that improve engagement and relevance.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion : Untapped Mobile Market</h3>
    <p>By adopting this new design blueprint, <strong><em>Microsoft PowerPoint</em></strong> <strong><em>on
                mobile</em></strong> could become significantly more user-friendly and engaging. PowerPoint remains
        indispensable in professional settings, yet its mobile potential is underutilized. By adopting a
        smartphone-first design philosophy—embracing portrait layouts, intuitive gestures, and interactivity—Microsoft
        can dominate this niche, transforming digital presentations into seamless, inclusive experiences.</p>

    <p>I invite Microsoft to consider this proposal and explore collaboration opportunities to bring this vision to
        life.</p>
